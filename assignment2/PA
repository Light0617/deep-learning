Model A: 5 dimensional embedding, 100 dimensional hidden layer
Model B: 50 dimensional embedding, 10 dimensional hidden layer
Model C: 50 dimensional embedding, 200 dimensional hidden layer

Model C

8.
In the models trained in Question 7, which one gives the best validation set cross entropy after 10 epochs of training ? [2 points]
Model C

9.
Train three models each with 50 dimensional embedding space, 200 dimensional hidden layer.
Model A: Momentum = 0.0
Model B: Momentum = 0.5
Model C: Momentum = 0.9
Use the default settings for all other hyperparameters. Which model gives the lowest training set cross entropy after 5 epochs ? [3 points]

Model C

10.
Train a model with 50 dimensional embedding layer and 200 dimensional hidden layer for 10 epochs. Use default values for all other hyperparameters.
Which words are among the 10 closest words to the word 'day'. [2 points]

'week'
'night'

Train a model with 50 dimensional embedding layer and 200 dimensional hidden layer for 10 epochs. Use default values for all other hyperparameters.
Which words are among the 10 closest words to the word 'could'. [2 points]


'should'
'can'


11.
In the model trained in Question 10, why is the word 'percent' close to 'dr.' even though they have very different contexts and are not expected to be close in word embedding space? [2 points]

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.


12.
In the model trained in Question 10, why is 'he' close to 'she' even though they refer to completely different genders? [2 points]

The model does not care about gender. It puts them close because if 'he' occurs in a 4-gram, it is very likely that substituting it by 'she' will also make a sensible 4-gram.

13.
In conclusion, what kind of words does the model put close to each other in embedding space. Choose the most appropriate answer. [3 points]

Words that can be substituted for one another and still make up a sensible 4-gram.
